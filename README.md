# Setting Up Your React Project for the CV Generator

## 1. Install Node.js and npm

First, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## 2. Create a New React Project

You can use Create React App, a popular tool for setting up new React projects. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx create-react-app cv-generator
cd cv-generator
```

This creates a new React project named "cv-generator" and navigates into the project directory.

## 3. Install Additional Dependencies

Install the necessary additional packages:

```bash
npm install @/components/ui jspdf html2canvas
```

Note: The `@/components/ui` package might not be available as is. You may need to set up shadcn/ui separately or use an alternative UI library like Material-UI or Chakra UI.

## 4. Replace the Content of src/App.js

Replace the content of `src/App.js` with the CV Generator component we created earlier.

## 5. Update src/index.js

Make sure `src/index.js` is set up to render your App component:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

## 6. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start your development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Your React application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 7. Further Development

- Implement the missing parts of the CV Generator component, such as the HTML generation logic.
- Style your components as needed.
- Test the application thoroughly, especially the PDF generation feature.

## 8. Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy your application, you can create a production build by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized version of your app in the `build` folder, which you can then deploy to a web server.
